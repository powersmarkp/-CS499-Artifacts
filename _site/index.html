        <h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>I have always had a fascination for computers ever since I was little, so it’s no surprise that I would take an interest in computer Science now that I’m older. I started teaching myself how to code but when I found out that a degree in computer science would open up a lot of employment opportunities, I enrolled at SNHU and have been amazed not only by how much I’ve learned but also how much I’ve loved learning it all. 
<br /></p>

<p><em><strong>A Summary of My Skills</strong></em><br />
The first language I learned was Python in Intro to Scripting, and I was amazed at how easy it was to write simple programs that would eventually evolve to become much more complex. The final project was a text based game that would combine everything I had learned in that first course and serve as my first great challenge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/textBasedGameSnippet.png" alt="Python Text Based Game" /> <br /></p>

<p>Later, my classes had me learning new languages like C++ and Java, but anyone who knows anything about computer science knows that it’s not just about learning programming languages, it’s about learning to think like a computer scientist, and this was reflected in the coursework. I learned how to organize projects and make solid plans before starting work, to ensure that I was approaching each project with the stakeholders and the clients requirements in the forefront of my mind. <br /><br />
I made LOTS of diagrams…<br /></p>

<img src="/images/PracticeTestDiagram.png" alt="Practice Test Diagram" /><br /></p>

<p>…and I’ve learned about standard practices that will help me create programs that make it easy to collaborate with others or pass my completed portion of a project on to my peers for near seamless integraton. An important aspect of creating programs and applications is that they must be secure. I found out quickly that this goes well beyond a user name and password. And so, I began generating certficates and performing dependency checks. <br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/CertificateGeneration.png" alt="Certificate Generation" /> <br /><br />
<img src="/images/DependencyCheck.png" alt="Dependency Check" /><br /></p>

<p>The next skills I would obtain were being able to understand and implement databases and data structures. I didn’t seem to have any trouble with databases and was fascinated by how much large amounts of data could be manipulated or isolated with SQL to find very specific pieces of information.<br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/sqlSnippet.png" alt="SQL Snippet" /><br /></p>

<p>Data structures were different however. As my first major challenge, I understood how things like linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees worked, but I had the hardest time getting the code correct. If nothing else, I am persistant and I spent a lot of time at my computer studying not only data structures but Java as well, hoping to finally make sense of binary search trees. My determination paid off as I was able to complete that course and move on to my next challenge. Below is a piece of my pseudocode that I used to make sense of it all.<br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/BinarySearch.png" alt="Binary Search Pseudo" /><br /></p>

<p>After all of this hard work, I’ve arrived at the Computer Science Capstone. This course isn’t the end, but the beginning. I’m not just writing code to finish assignments; I’m setting a standard. Each and every piece of work that I touch from this point forward will be a reflection of all that I’ve learned and will show that I have attained the skills needed to be a valuable asset to the computer science industry. I want my work to speak for me and this is…<br /></p>

<p><em><strong>What My Work Says About Me</strong></em><br /></p>

<p>The projects that I’ve completed up to this point have been stepping stones in which I’ve learned and forgotten countless lessons. One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned is that it’s not about what you remember because nobody can remember everything. 
What’s most important is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remembering enough to get started in the right  direction</li>
  <li>Knowing where to go to fill in the gaps and</li>
  <li>Having the right tools to make it all happen <br /></li>
</ul>

<p>The artifact enhancements I’ve made in this capstone course are a demonstration of my ability to adhere to these important ideas and deliver a quality product that not only meets but exceeds client requirements.
<br />
——————————————————————————————————————————————–
<br />
Enhancement One revisits an artifact originally written in Python using Spyder and Jupyter Notebook. The client was Austin Animal Center and they were looking to upgrade their records keeping system from an excel sheet to a database with a dashboard that would allow them to sort and filter the data for the 10,000 entries it would contain. My enhancement to this project demonstrates my ability to understand client requirements and should the requirements change, I possess the software engineering skills to adapt and produce exactly the results the client is looking for.
<br />
——————————————————————————————————————————————–
<br />
Enhancement Two pertains to a to-do list app I made in IT390. The app is written in Java and built using Android Studio. We were given a lot of freedom to design our apps as we wanted, but they had to incorporate a database for storing the data related to the prompt that we chose, and we had to adhere to industry standards as far as creating an excellent user interface and user experience. I enhanced this artifact by upgrading the main data structure from a list to a linked list. I realized after making the changes that such an upgrade is a bit underwhelming, but for an app as simple as a to-do list, something as complex as a binary search tree or a hash table is just not required. That being said, I do understand when my programs will need a more fast and efficient data structure. While making the changes to the list structure, I took the opportunity to clean up my code, add more comments, and do whatever else I could to bring my project up to an acceptable industry standard. My applications don’t just work, they are a pleasure to use and are scalable should the need arise.
<br />

<br />
Enhancement Three uses the same artifact as Enhancement One but builds upon the program’s new structure written in Java. I upgraded the program from a basic dashboard with a couple of sort and filter functions to a more involved and organized app that offers secure login, a smooth user interface, and of course the CRUD functionality that the client requires most. This enhancement was a lot of fun for me because I got a chance to do both the frontend and backend work for a project and see exactly how dependent they are on each other to work smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="code-review">Code Review</h2>
<p>Before beginning work on enhancing my past projects, I had to do a code review to get an idea of what kind of improvements would need to be made to each. You can view my code review on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHoYUg8VfsY&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">Youtube.</a></p>

<h2 id="original-artifacts">Original Artifacts</h2>
<p>I created a to-do list app on Android Studio which was written in Java. It was a simple application but served as an introduction to methods of holding data other than local storage. View the original to-do list app

<p>The other artifact that I enhanced was a dashboard app written in Python for storing a massive number of entries containing data on various animals for the Austin Animal Center. Click

to see the original dashboard app.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-enhancements">Artifact Enhancements</h2>

<p>I enhanced the data structure of the to-do list app by changing the list that stored tasks to a linked list and made some changes to the code by cleaing up the spacing and ensuring there was proper commenting.

<p>For the other two categories, I rewrote the dashboard app in Java and created a much more pleasant user interface. I also implemented the other CRUD functions not present in the original app so that users could add, edit, and delete entries.
